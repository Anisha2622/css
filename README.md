## CSS Concepts Used

- External stylesheet (style.css)
- CSS selectors: element, class, pseudo-class
- Color scheme using CSS variables
- Flexbox layout for skills section
- Hover effects on navigation and buttons
- Responsive design using media queries
- Custom Google Font (Poppins)

## Design Decisions
The design uses a clean and modern layout with a blue color theme. Flexbox is used for flexible layout and responsiveness. The interface is kept simple and readable.

## Responsiveness
Media queries are used to ensure the website adapts to mobile screens. Skills section stacks vertically on small devices and layout adjusts automatically.
